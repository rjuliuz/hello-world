# hello-world
Another FullStack developer appears, my name is Rafael Julio and at thirty-six years of age I decided to change my career and I will do my best to not only learn, but to evolve and be who I really want in the future. I live in Fortaleza, Brazil. I'm starting with the basics, which is html, css and javascript, but after that I intend to delve into react and go to the back-end, like nodejs, typescript and mysql. I accept suggestions too.
